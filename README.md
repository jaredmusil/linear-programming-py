iawsc-data-toolbox
==================

What is it?
-----------

The IAWSC data toolbox is a wrapper program for several command line scripts. Most of these scripts 
have very specific instructions on how to use them. By combining them into a single program, many of the 
small gotcha's can be avoided. Hopefully this helps save time and sanity.


Installation
------------

No install is required. A portable version of Python and R is included in the program files. To run the program double click the launch-app shortcut.

If you would like a fancy icon for the program do the following after placing the executable somewhere static:
[ Rightclick launch-app.ink --> Properties --> Change Icon... --> Browse to included icon.ico file ].
The app will run just fine sans-fancy icon however.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation on the individual scripts can be found within the program. A generic overview of 
the individual scripts can be found on the Help tab while script specific information can be found 
on the tabs Instruction box.

Version
-------

The most up to date version is 0.6

- Fixed bug where program would crash if output files are not moved. The program now overwrites existing files.
- The help tab instructions were improved and a few grammar mistakes corrected.
