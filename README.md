linear-programming-gui
======================

What is it?
-----------

This program will eventually provide a nice easy to use front end for linear programming and optimization problems. The aim of this is to lower the learning curve required to make use of this valuable technique. My hope is that it will allow users to branch into more complex LP tools such as the Microsoft Excel solver and beyond.


Installation
------------

No install is required. A portable version of Python is included in the program files. To run the program double click the launch-app shortcut.

If you would like a fancy icon for the program do the following after placing the executable somewhere static:
[ Rightclick launch-app.ink --> Properties --> Change Icon --> Browse to included icon.ico file ].
The app will run just fine sans-fancy icon however.
