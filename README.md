======================

What is it?
-----------

This program will eventually provide a nice easy to use front end for linear programming and optimization problems. The aim of this is to lower the learning curve required to make use of this valuable technique. My hope is that it will allow users to branch into more complex LP tools such as the Microsoft Excel solver and beyond.
